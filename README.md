# Searching Algorithms

This is a simple and illustrative implementation of multiple searching algorithms that can be visualized.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.6+ 

No external libreries required.

### Algorithms

- Depth First Search: (blind) (not optimal) 
- Breadth First Search: (blind) (optimal)
- Iterative DFS: (blind) (optimal)
- Best First Search: (aware) (not optimal)
- A Star: (aware) (optimal)

Blind algorithms are not aware of the final cell position (a.k.a uninformed search algorithms), whereas aware algorithms
do know the final cell position so they can use that information (a.k.a informed search algorithms).
